# Interactive Python - Mac

1. Start up a `Terminal` command prompt. You can find the `Terminal` application through Spotlight, or navigate to `Applications/Utilities/Terminal`.
2. To start Python, type  
`python`  
at the command prompt and hit enter. You should see something like  
```
Python 2.7.1 (r261:67515, Feb 11 2010, 00:51:29) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
The `>>>` indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

3.Exit the Python prompt by typing  
`exit()`  
andand hitting enter. Now you're back at the OS X command prompt (which looks something like `<yourname>$`).

### Success!
Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
