# Set up Python - Linux

Linux ships with Python installed, so the goal of this page is to make sure you can start a Terminal and run Python from the command line.

1. Start up an instance of `terminal`.  
You can find the Terminal application through the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+T`
  
  This Terminal contains something called a command prompt.  
  This command prompt is another way of navigating your computer and running programs -- just textually instead of graphically.
  We are going to be running Python and Python scripts from this command prompt.
2. Test your Python install at the command prompt. Type  
  `python`  
  and hit enter. You should see something like  

  ```
  Python 2.7.1 (r252:60911, Jan 24 2011, 17:44:40) 
  [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 
  ```
  * You just started Python! The `>>>` indicates that you are at a new type of prompt -- a Python prompt.  
    The command prompt let's you navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt lets you write and run Python code interactively.
  * If the Python version number (2.7.1 in the example above) is not a number between 2.4 and 2.7 (ignoring the number after the second dot), tell a staff member.
3. To exit the Python prompt, type  
`exit()`  
and press Enter. This will take you back to the OS X command prompt.

### Success!

You have Python installed and configured.
