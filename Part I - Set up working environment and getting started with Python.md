# Setting up your Python working environment

This part was shamelessly copied from http://wiki.openhatch.org/Boston_Python_Workshop_6/Friday (with tiny modification).  

The reason for the copying and not using original source is to avoid the risk of the original source not available during the class for any reason.

## Goal #1: Set up Python

This section has instructions for installing Python and running Python from a command prompt.

* [Windows](./Windows_set_up_Python.md)
* [Mac](./OSX_set_up_Python.md)
* [Linux](./Linux_set_up_Python.md)

## Goal #2: Prepare a text editor

In addition to being able to run Python, we are going to install a good text editor for writing and saving Python code during the workshop.  

If you would like to use a different text editor from the recommendation for your operating system, please let a staff member know.

* [Sublime Text (available for Windows/Mac/Linux)](./Text_editor.md)

## Goal #3: Practice starting and exiting Python

We'll do a lot of learning and practicing at a Python prompt (this is "interactive" because you are typing the code and hitting enter to run it yourself, instead of running it from a file).  
So let's practice starting and exiting Python:

* [Windows](./Windows_interactive_Python.md)
* [Mac / Linux](./Mac_Linux_interactive_Python.md)

## Goal #4: Practice navigating the computer from a command prompt

We will be running files containing Python code (Python "scripts") from the command prompt.  
You'll need to be able to navigate to those scripts using the command prompt so you can run them.  
In this section, we'll practice using these navigation commands.

* [Windows](./Windows_terminal_navigation.md)
* [Mac / Linux](./Mac_linx_terminal_navigation.md)

## Goal #5: Practice running Python code from a file

Interactive Python programming at a Python prompt is great for short pieces of code and for testing ideas.  
For longer code, it can be easier to save the code in a file, and execute the contents of that file (aka a Python script).  
In this section, we'll practice running Python scripts.

* [Windows](./Windows_Python_scripts.md)
* [Mac](./OSX_Python_scripts.md)
* [Linux](./Linux_Python_scripts.md)

## Goal #6: Explain about dependencies and getting them installed

A good Programmer is a Lazy programmer. We are going to use a lot of code that other people wrote to make our life easier.  

Here we are going to explain about the wonderful and confusing world of dependencies/vendor code/3rd party libraries and what is the Pythonic way of using them.  

We'll also talk about the horrible problem of versioning and how that makes life hard and what can we do to mitigate that

* [Windows](./Windows_project_dependencies.md)
* [Mac](./OSX_project_dependencies.md)
* [Linux](./Linux_project_dependencies.md)

## Goal #7: Start learning Python!

It's time to start learning, reading, and writing some Python!  
We'll start you off with working through a mostly self-directed tutorial (feel free to ask questinos though!).  
Later, we'll have an interactive lecture to cover more Python basics.

[Self-directed Tutorial](./Self_Directed_Tutorial.md)

## Goal #8: Start learning Python!

Learning about functions opened up a whole new way for us to practice, using the programming site codingbat.com.  
The big goal of this practice section is to get you thinking about how to solve problems in Python.

[Self-directed Tutorial](./CodingBat_Using_Codingbat.md)

You don't have to create a CodingBat account to do the exercises, but if you do create an account it'll keep track of which problems you've completed and other statistics.
