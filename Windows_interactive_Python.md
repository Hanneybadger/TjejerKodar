# Interactive Python - Windows

1. Open a command prompt:
  * On Windows Vista or Windows 7: click on the Start menu (the Windows logo in the lower left of the screen), type cmd into the Search field directly above the Start menu button, and click on "cmd" in the search results above the Search field.
  * On Windows XP: click on the Start menu (the Windows logo in the lower left of the screen), click on "Run...", type cmd into the text box, and hit enter.
2. To start Python, type  
`python`  
at the command prompt and hit enter. You should see something like  
```
Python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, ...) on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
The `>>>` indicates that you are at a Python prompt.

3.Exit the Python prompt by typing  
`exit()`  
and hitting enter. Now you're back at the Windows command prompt (`C:\`).

### Success!
Practice these steps until you feel comfortable navigating to a command prompt, starting Python, and exiting Python.
